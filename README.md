# hello-world

Hi! My name is Grace, a fourth year college student at the University of Notre Dame.

I'm double majoring in Business Analytics and Chinese, and want to combine my passions for data science, social advocacy, and environmentalism once I graduate from the University.

When I'm not in class I can be found mountaineering, hiking, painting, playing piano, reading, or taking an unneccessary number of photos of my kitten.
